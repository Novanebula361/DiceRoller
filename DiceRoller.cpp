/**
 *  How do I handle rolling dice? What cases should I account for?
 *  CASE 1: sum all rolls together (should be its own function)
 *  CASE 2: add modifier to roll(s)
 *  CASE 3: list all rolls individually (requires mapping between die type and result)
 *  CASE 4: sum rolls only within dice types (seems useless...)
